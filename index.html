<h1>Personal Profile for Jason Davis</h1>

<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<pre>
Name: Jason Davis
Student Number: s3866226
E-mail: s3866226@student.rmit.edu.au

I am Jason Davis.  I live in Adelaide, South Australia.
I am an IT professional, and have been working in IT for the last 13 years on a full time basis. During that time, I’ve worked for 
private and Government entities, in various roles.  

Before this, I worked primarily in telecommunications, with both Telstra and Commander Australia, in network faults.

I completed my Diploma of Information Technology (Internetworking) at Adelaide TAFE in 2005. 

I hold multiple industry certifications, KCA, MCP, ITIL, CCNA Voice, CCNA Security, CCNP Route Switch, 
CCNP Enterprise, Cisco Specialist – Enterprise Advanced Infrastructure Implementation, Cisco Specialist Enterprise Core.
On top of this, I have also run my own business for the last 8 years, where I provide security consultation, design, 
and also host servers in a datacentre environment here in Adelaide. 

I am certified as an Information Systems Security Professional, by the US Government under US DoD 8570 and CNSS 4011.  
These are issued by the NSA, the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) and the US Department of Defence.  

I am also a carer for my Mum, and I am currently also studying for my CCIE Enterprise certification.

In what little spare time I have left, I enjoy taking a drive in the countryside, or going for a walk along the beach somewhere.  
That is how I zone out and recharge. 
I enjoy watching movies, and I can’t resist a good wood oven pizza with friends.  Anchovies are my friends.
I enjoy AFL – Sadly, I am an Adelaide Crows supporter.  Things are not good at the moment.  
It is a bit of a struggle to watch footy with no crows.  Just doesn’t seem quite right.  For me, the fake crowd noise makes it worse.
I have a cat.  His name is Morty.  I am pretty sure he thinks I’m a failure, as while I’ve been working from home, 
he often stares at me and assumes the loser has been fired. I’ve shown him my payslip, but I don’t think he believes it.  

This is me:

<h2>My Interest in IT</h2>

<h3>What is your interest in IT?</h3>
<pre>
I work as a Network Engineer, and networks and security are where my interests lie.  
It is hard to explain it, but I am just fascinated by the way data moves, 
how it finds its way from one host to another, past firewalls, through routers, switches, all without getting lost.  
When you imagine the path a simple web request for Google may take, from your PC, through your router, 
generating a random port number, NATing of traffic, route lookups by your ISP, passing ACLs, passing reverse proxy server, 
to eventually hit the Google server – then it has to find it’s way back.  It may even take an entirely different path, 
but it will still find its way back – thanks to BGP.  
</pre>
<h3>When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular
event or person that sparked your interest?</h3>
<pre>
My interest in IT was sparked in the end of 1999.  Prior to this, I had been working part time, and studying towards a 
Degree in Mechanical Engineering.  My father died in 1998 when I was 22 years old, and I lost my way after that.  
I gave up studying Mechanical Engineering, I wasn’t motivated for work, and I really had no direction, no future 
aspirations and was just floundering in every aspect of life.
Centrelink actually helped me there.  They pushed me through the Work for The Dole program to do a short course in computing.  
I wasn’t really interested in it, but had to go 1 day a week.  
Thanks to Francine Murphy, my teacher there, who encouraged me.  As, if not for her, I would not be a student at RMIT today.  
I would not have my Diploma in IT, or any of my industry certifications.  
The computing course was pretty basic, just a bunch of exercises to get the best out of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Publisher.  
Through her encouragement, I ended up doing extra work, as she said I was quite talented as far as IT went.  
So, she gave me a book on HTML3.2.  I created a fake website (it was pretty basic) for an imaginary wildlife park in Tasmania.  
Called Ringarooma Wildlife Park.  I also ended up in the course 5 days a week – which nobody had ever done before, and I was helping others 
there who needed help in class.  
Through this, the course providers COMSKILL helped me get work at the local council.  
Francine encouraged me to then study part-time at night at Adelaide TAFE, to get my Certificate 3 in IT.  
But I ended up going all the way to my Diploma.  My average grade at TAFE were all distinctions.  Except for PERL which I barely passed!
I have no idea where Francine is today.  I wish I could say thank-you.  I wouldn’t be where I am now without her.

<h2>My IT experience</h2>
<pre>
I have worked in IT for the last 13 years.  I’m currently employed as a network engineer, where I manage almost 900 Cisco routers, 
and a lot of switches too.  I have a lot of industry certifications, and also have a Diploma of Information Technology from Adelaide TAFE.  

</pre>
<h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
<pre>
I have actually been thinking about learning some programming for a long time now.  I was always a bit scared to take the plunge.  
Perhaps due to previous experiences.  In my Diploma I had to do a semester of PERL programming, and it was a complete mystery to me.  
I understood nothing that I was doing really, and the lecturer was no help.  It was just a matter of follow the examples in the book, 
try to work it out, submit your work.  The lecturer insisted that we always had the lights off and worked in the dark in the classroom, 
which was interesting.  
I had a look at the courses at OUA.  I didn’t want to leave full time work to study, and the idea of studying from home appealed to me, 
and OUA said the RMIT course was really good.  I had heard of RMIT, and it seemed to have a good reputation.  So, here I am!

</pre>
<h2>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
<pre> 
I am hoping to learn some programming.  I have a few ideas that I would like to create into something meaningful.  
Something that works.  These aren’t so much ideas to sell to become the next tech billionaire, but rather ideas of tools 
which would really help me in my job role as a network engineer.  If I could sell it through my business, great, but I just 
want to be able to use it myself.  
If I can also gain a better understanding of how software goes together, to enable me to do my job better, and be a better engineer, 
this would also be a great outcome.  

</pre>

<h2>My Ideal Job</h2>
<pre>
I already work in a role that is almost my ideal job.  The only part that is currently missing from my ideal job is doing more design, 
implementation, and security work than I do now.
I would more like to work in a specific industry segment, doing a role that I am currently doing, or slightly extended including more 
implementation and security.  I have applied for a few roles like <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50038899" target="_blank">this</a>,and I have recently applied for this job here in Adelaide.
I would like to work in a Network/Security Engineering role in defence.  
I would like to work in defence, to be exposed more to industry leading solutions, and to also feel that my work is contributing to the 
defence of Australia.  
I have found that a lot of work I have done in IT, makes no meaningful contribution.  That is something I would like to change. 
Click here to see the job I applied for.
I have all the skills required for this role, the only thing I do not have is the defence clearance.  This is often a sticking point with 
getting a role like this, as all employers seem to insist you have one already, but it is only a defence contractor who can apply for a 
clearance, which is a little frustrating.  
This particular role is working for the French company who has won the contract to design and build the future submarines for the 
Royal Australian Navy.  It is to provide design and deployment of network hardware and infrastructure for offices, new shipyards, and 
also be a technical escalation point for faults.  This will also involve ongoing troubleshooting, monitoring, Maintenance and 
Adds/Moves/Changes for the network infrastructure that supports the design and build project.  Due to the sensitivity of the information, 
this will also allow me to have more hands-on experience with advanced security technologies and configurations at layers 2 and 3, 
with such things as 802.1x.
The thought of gaining employment in this type of role is very exciting to me.

<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
<pre>
The results of my online personality profile tests are as follows:
Myers-Briggs type results done through 16 personalities: <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/isfj-personality" target="_blank">Defender ISFJ-T</a>
Online learning test results done through Education Planner:<a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-styles.shtml" target="_blank">Auditory Learner.</a>
The third test I decided to do was an online Big 5 personality test, done at Open Psychometrics.  The results are available <a href="big5.html">here.</a>

The results of these tests are meaningless to me.  I am unable to find any certain science that these tests are 100% accurate.  
They are subject to an “interpretation” on what someone answers to each question.  However, they lack any intelligence in relating to 
someone’s personal experiences in their assessments.  An individual’s work experience, what country they were raised in, could all 
influence the results of these tests.  
I would be concerned by any employer who would use this sort of thing to make decisions on people.  I certainly would not work there.  
I find them inaccurate, and they don’t really represent my effectiveness in doing my job.  I would suggest they are about as reliable as 
astrology or tarot.
